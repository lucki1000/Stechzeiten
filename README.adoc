= **Stechzeiten**

== **Install:**

=== *First of all we need Python3 and pip3.*
=== For Ubuntu/Debian/RaspberryPiOSi:
```sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip```
=== *Then we need spidev and the mfrc522 module*
```sudo pip3 install spidev```
```sudo pip3 install mfrc522```
=== *If you on RaspberryPiOS(former Raspbian) you also need to activate spi over the raspi-config menu, and don't forget the reboot.*

== **Goals:**

=== - **connection to a ext. DB and write files into**
=== - **Web Viewer**


== *A project by Lukas Bonrath*
